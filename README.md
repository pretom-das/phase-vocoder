# phase-vocoder
This repository contains the implementation of a Phase Vocoder audio processing system, featuring a Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed in MATLAB. The Phase Vocoder allows for time-stretching, pitch-shifting, and spectral manipulation of audio signals with high precision and minimal distortion.
